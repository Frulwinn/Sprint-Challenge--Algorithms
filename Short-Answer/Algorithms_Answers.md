Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a) run time = O(n)
The run time is linear time because the number of additional operations the algorithm needs to perform grows in direct proportion to the increase in input size.

b) run time = O(n^4)
It's a nested loop so it requires multiple operations for input i, j, k, and l. When we add all the loops we get quadratic time.

c) run time = O(n)
With a base case of 0 this method will rund down till it reaches 0 so the algorithm decreases in direct proportion to the input size which makes it linear time.
